# Python-Festival_Sales_Analysis

Hello Everyone,
I'm excited to share this project where I utilized the power of Python and its various libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to conduct an in-depth analysis of Festival sales data.

## Key Steps Followed :-
- Loaded the necessary libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, to leverage their powerful functionalities for data analysis.
- Imported and loaded the data from CSV format into Python using the Pandas library, allowing for seamless data manipulation and analysis.
- Performed data checks to understand the data, including examining the shape of the dataset, identifying any null values, and analyzing data types.
- Removed unnecessary columns that were not relevant to the analysis, streamlining the dataset for focused insights.
- Conducted data cleaning by checking and removing null values, considering their contribution to the overall dataset. Null values were dropped if their impact was minimal.
- Converted data types of columns as required, ensuring consistency and compatibility for subsequent analysis.
- Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to delve into the data, uncover patterns, correlations, and generate valuable insights. This involved visualizing the data using various techniques, such as histograms, scatter plots, and box plots.
- Made final predictions and drew conclusions based on the analysis, providing actionable recommendations to optimize sales strategies and enhance business performance during Festival.

## Project Learnings & Conclusion :- 
* Improved customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups.
* Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.
* Most of the buyers are married women (age group 26-35) and they have high purchasing power.
* Most of the orders & total sales/amount are from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Karnataka respectively.
* Most of the buyers are working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation sector.
* Most of the sold products are from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.
